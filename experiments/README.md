The motion capture system had a sampling frequency of 200 Hz.

The IMUs were sampled at 500 Hz.

In each experiment a time synchronization phase was performed where the rig
was rotated around the x-axis. Then numerical differentiation of the rotation
matrix estimate given by the motion capture system can be compared with the
gyroscope measurements to estimate the time-shift between the two systems.
